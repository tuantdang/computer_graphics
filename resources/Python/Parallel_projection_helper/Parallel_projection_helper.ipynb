        "This notebook provides a walkthrough of the few initial steps involved in the parallel projection process, offering an understanding of how the projection matrix is formed. While the preliminary calculations are outlined, your goal is to extend this notebook by completing the remaining steps necessary to derive the full parallel projection composite matrix. This involves continuing the matrix transformations and calculations that represent the complete parallel projection composite matrix\n",

        "# Note about Homogeneous Coordinates:\n",
        "In 3D space, a point (x,y,z) is typically represented in homogeneous coordinates as (x,y,z,w), where w is the additional homogeneous coordinate.\n",
        "When w=1, the point represents a finite, regular point in space.\n",
        "When\n",
        "w=0, the representation is used to denote a vector or direction rather than a specific location in space.\n",
        "\n",
        "When performing transformations like translation, it is important to distinguish between points and vectors.\n",
        "Points move when translated, but vectors should not be affected by translations (only by rotations, scaling, etc.).\n",
        "Setting w=0 for vectors ensures that when a translation matrix is applied, the vector remains unchanged, because translation only affects entities with a w value of 1 (i.e., points).\n",
        "\n",
        "Homogeneous coordinates allow us to use a single matrix (4x4 in 3D) to apply all types of transformations—translation, rotation, scaling—uniformly.\n",
        "By setting\n",
        "w=0 for vectors, we can apply these transformations correctly without moving vectors, which is crucial for maintaining correct geometry during operations."

        "In the parallel projection, the 3D view volume can be mapped to a unit cube which is bounded by the planes x=0 ; x = 1 ; y=0 ; y = 1 ; z=0 ; z=1. However, It is more common to map the parallel projection view volume to a rectangular box (cuboid) which is bounded by the planes x=-1 ; x = 1 ; y=-1 ; y = 1 ; z=0 ; z=1. This is done to make the parallel projection parameters more consistent with the perspective projection parameters.\n",
