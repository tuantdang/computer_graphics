    "## Graphics Pipeline\n",
    "Graphics pipeline is a conceptual model which is used in computer graphics systems to describe a series of steps which needs to be performed to display a 3-dimensional scene on a 2-dimensional screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since computer graphics packages depend on different hardware and software systems, there is no universal graphics pipeline. for example the graphics pipelines for Direct3D and OpenGL are different from each other. Some of the steps in a graphics pipeline are implemented in hardware to accelerate the rendering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graphics pipeline usually has three main components as shown below. \n",
