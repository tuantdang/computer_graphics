    "In order to be able to display the objects in the real world to the screen, we need to define a process that maps from 3-dimensional coordinate system to a 2-dimensional plane. This process is called projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a projection we need to define a projection plane. \n",
    "* The projection plane is defined by a point on the plane and a vector normal to the plane. \n",
    "* The point on the plane is called ** View Reference Point (VRP) **\n",
    "* The normal to the projection plane is called ** View Plane Normal (VPN) ** \n",
    "* The **VRP** is the origin of the **View Reference Coorinate (VRC)** system, which is also called camera coordinate system.\n",
    "* Rather than $x$, $y$, and $z$, the 3 axes on the **VRC** are called $u$ , $v$ , and $n$. \n",
    "* The **VPN** is the $n$ axis of the **VRC**  coordinate system.\n",
    "* A vector called **View Up Vector (VUP)** determines the $v$ axis of the **VRC** system. Notice that the **VUP** vector is not the same as the $v$ axis of the **VRC**, rather, the projection of the **VUP** on the projection plane is the $v$ axis.\n",
    "* The $u$ axis of the **VRC** is determined by the cross product of the $v$ and $n$ axes.\n",
