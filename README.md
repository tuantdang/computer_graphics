## Notes
- Explanation and Code posted at Colab can help you quickly to understand concepts and try out them for deeper understanding.
- Code in Github sometimes take extra steps (i.e, eviroment setup, library installations, boostrap code,..) to run since it aims to compensate functionalities that cannot be done in Colab environments. 

## Tools
- Google Colab
- Python Jupiter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, sympy, OpenGL
